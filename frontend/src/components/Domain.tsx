      The tourism industry, especially in Sri Lanka, is shifting from static
      services to personalized and intelligent travel experiences driven by
      digital and AI technologies. Traditional systems struggle to handle the
      complexities of group travel, dynamic budgeting, and real-time
      adaptability. The proposed AI-powered tourism platform addresses these
      challenges by integrating advanced techniques such as collaborative and
      content-based filtering, semantic modelling (Sentence-BERT), and ranking
      algorithms (LambdaRank, LightGBM) to create intelligent group matching and
      adaptive recommendations. It further incorporates geospatial planning,
      real-time budgeting, and conversational agents for interactive
      collaboration. Tailored to Sri Lankaâ€™s diverse tourism landscape, this
      system promotes personalization, cultural awareness, sustainability, and
      seamless coordinationâ€”offering a transformative approach to modern travel
      planning and experience.

        Existing tourism platforms mainly focus on individual recommendations

        factors.

      <li>
        Current systems lack real-time adaptability and geospatial awareness,
        resulting in static and impractical travel plans.

        Most budgeting solutions donâ€™t account for real-time price fluctuations
        or predictive analytics, leading to inaccurate financial planning.

        No unified system combines group matching, personalized itineraries, and
        adaptive budgeting within one intelligent, AI-driven framework.

        Current systems do not intelligently recommend compatible travel groups
        based on usersâ€™ preferences, interests, and behaviors, nor do they

        Existing platforms lack intelligent mechanisms to match travelers based

          Rigid and Inefficient Itinerary Planning:{" "}

        Current systems generate static, context-insensitive itineraries that

        optimization, leading to poor travel experiences.

        Most budgeting tools fail to adapt to real-time cost changes in
